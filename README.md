# Agrihire Shopping Web App

## Description
This repository showcases part of a school group project, a dynamic full-stack shopping web application developed for AgriHire Solutions. The app modernizes the company's equipment hire process, offering a user-friendly platform where customers can browse, book, and manage machinery rentals.

Customers can easily check equipment availability, make bookings, pay in advance, extend hires, and track their rental history. They can also communicate with staff regarding equipment, bookings, and other inquiries.

Staff and managers have access to tools for inventory management, equipment tracking, and customer support. The system also includes features for handling promotions, reporting, and equipment maintenance, ensuring a streamlined and efficient operation that meets the needs of AgriHireâ€™s nationwide business.

## Agile Methodologies
We employed Agile methodologies throughout this project, ensuring iterative progress, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.

As the Scrum Master, I managed task assignments, identified project dependencies, and broke down larger work items into manageable tasks. My primary focus included analyzing user requirements, designing the database, and developing key functionalities such as login and registration, user management, equipment and inventory management, and rental checkout.

## Efficient Database Design
- General Design:
 - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) track record creation and modifications for auditing and change tracking.
 - Soft deletes are enabled with the is_deleted field, allowing records to be marked as deleted without removal.
- Table-Specific Design:
 - Inventories and Equipment: Users add batches as inventory, with default location set to store 1 (national store). Each item has a unique serial number, and inventory management tracks purchase and status (active, repairing, retired).
 - Categories and Types: Categories group equipment types (e.g., tractors), with detailed fields for specifications, quantity, hire price, and period.
